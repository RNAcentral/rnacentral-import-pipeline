COMMENT     PROVISIONAL REFSEQ: This record is based on preliminary annotation
            provided by NCBI staff in collaboration with miRBase. The reference
            sequence was derived from AC097314.27.
            On Apr 22, 2014 this sequence version replaced NR_106968.1.
            
            Summary: microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs
            that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene
            expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the
            stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA
            polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary
            transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein-coding or
            non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha
            ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop
            precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the
            cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and
            antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is
            incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which
            recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the
            miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or
            destabilization of the target mRNA. The RefSeq represents the
            predicted microRNA stem-loop. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009].
            
            Sequence Note: This record represents a predicted microRNA
            stem-loop as defined by miRBase. Some sequence at the 5' and 3'
            ends may not be included in the intermediate precursor miRNA
            produced by Drosha cleavage.
