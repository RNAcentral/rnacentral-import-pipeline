RF00001	5S_rRNA	5S ribosomal RNA	SO:0000652	Gene; rRNA;	5S ribosomal RNA (5S rRNA) is a component of the large ribosomal subunit in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, it is synthesised by RNA polymerase III (the other eukaryotic rRNAs are cleaved from a 45S precursor synthesised by RNA polymerase I). In Xenopus oocytes, it has been shown that fingers 4-7 of the nine-zinc finger transcription factor TFIIIA can bind to the central region of 5S RNA. Thus, in addition to positively regulating 5S rRNA transcription, TFIIIA also stabilises 5S rRNA until it is required for transcription.	712	108778	CL00113	119
RF00002	5_8S_rRNA	5.8S ribosomal RNA	SO:0000375	Gene; rRNA;	5.8S ribosomal RNA (5.8S rRNA) is a component of the large subunit of the eukaryotic ribosome. It is transcribed by RNA polymerase I as part of the 45S precursor that also contains 18S and 28S rRNA. Functionally, it is thought that 5.8S rRNA may be involved in ribosome translocation [2]. It is also known to form covalent linkage to the p53 tumour suppressor protein [3]. 5.8S rRNA is also found in archaea.	61	4009	CL00112	154
RF00003	U1	U1 spliceosomal RNA	SO:0000391	Gene; snRNA; splicing;	U1 is a small nuclear RNA (snRNA) component of the spliceosome (involved in pre-mRNA splicing). Its 5' end forms complementary base pairs with the 5' splice junction, thus defining the 5' donor site of an intron. There are significant differences in sequence and secondary structure between metazoan and yeast U1 snRNAs, the latter being much longer (568 nucleotides as compared to 164 nucleotides in human). Nevertheless, secondary structure predictions suggest that all U1 snRNAs share a 'common core' consisting of helices I, II, the proximal region of III, and IV [1]. This family does not contain the larger yeast sequences.	100	11644	CL00005	166
RF00004	U2	U2 spliceosomal RNA	SO:0000392	Gene; snRNA; splicing;	U2 is a small nuclear RNA (snRNA) component of the spliceosome (involved in pre-mRNA splicing). Complementary binding between U2 snRNA (in an area lying towards the 5' end but 3' to hairpin I) and the branchpoint sequence (BPS) of the intron results the bulging out of an unpaired adenosine, on the BPS, which initiates a nucleophilic attack at the intronic 5' splice site, thus starting the first of two transesterification reactions that mediate splicing.	208	14355	CL00006	193
RF00005	tRNA	tRNA	SO:0000253	Gene; tRNA;	Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules are approximately 80 nucleotides in length. Their secondary structure includes four short double-helical elements and three loops (D, anti-codon, and T loops). Further hydrogen bonds mediate the characteristic L-shaped molecular structure. tRNAs have two regions of fundamental functional importance: the anti-codon, which is responsible for specific mRNA codon recognition, and the 3' end, to which the tRNAs corresponding amino acid is attached (by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases). tRNAs cope with the degeneracy of the genetic code in two manners: having more than one tRNA (with a specific anti-codon) for a particular amino acid; and 'wobble' base-pairing, i.e. permitting non-standard base-pairing at the 3rd anti-codon position.	954	1071476	CL00001	71
RF00006	Vault	Vault RNA	SO:0000404	Gene;	This family of RNAs are found as part of the enigmatic vault ribonucleoprotein complex. The complex consists of a major vault protein (MVP), two minor vault proteins (VPARP and TEP1), and several small untranslated RNA molecules. It has been suggested that the vault complex is involved in drug resistance. We have identified a putative novel vault RNA on chromosome 5 EMBL:AC005219.	73	550	NULL	101
RF00007	U12	U12 minor spliceosomal RNA	SO:0000399	Gene; snRNA; splicing;	The U12 small nuclear (snRNA), together with U4atac/U6atac, U5, and U11 snRNAs and associated proteins, forms a spliceosome that cleaves a divergent class of low-abundance pre-mRNA introns. Although the U12 sequence is very divergent from that of U2 (Rfam:RF00004), the two are functionally analogous [2]. The predicted secondary structure of U12 RNA is published (see for example, PMID:10199569), but the alternative single hairpin in the 3' end shown here seems to better match the alignment of divergent Drosophila and Arabidopsis sequences.	62	421	CL00006	155
RF00008	Hammerhead_3	Hammerhead ribozyme (type III)	SO:0000380	Gene; ribozyme;	The hammerhead ribozyme is one of the smallest catalytic RNAs. These RNAs have an endonuclease function, and most often are autocatalytic. Structurally it is composed of three base paired helices, separated by short linkers of conserved sequence. These helices are called I, II and III. We have classified hammerhead ribozymes into three types based on which helix the 5' and 3' ends of the sequence join. This family are the type III hammerheads. The conserved uridine-turn links helix I to helix II and usually has the sequence CUGA. Helix II and III are linked by a sequence CGAAA. The cleavage reaction occurs between helix III and I, and is usually a C. Hammerhead ribozymes are found in plant viroids and other small replicating satellite RNA species. Hammerhead ribozymes have been found in animals as well as plants. This family includes a couple of false matches currently these are EMBL:AC078923 and EMBL:BC050488. These animal sequences are not expected to be hammerhead ribozymes.	82	2641	CL00010	58
RF00009	RNaseP_nuc	Nuclear RNase P	SO:0000386	Gene; ribozyme;	Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a ubiquitous endoribonuclease, found in archaea, bacteria and eukarya as well as chloroplasts and mitochondria. Its best characterised activity is the generation of mature 5'-ends of tRNAs by cleaving the 5'-leader elements of precursor-tRNAs. Cellular RNase Ps are ribonucleoproteins. RNA from bacterial RNase Ps retains its catalytic activity in the absence of the protein subunit, i.e. it is a ribozyme. Isolated eukaryotic and archaeal RNase P RNA has not been shown to retain its catalytic function, but is still essential for the catalytic activity of the holoenzyme. Although the archaeal and eukaryotic holoenzyme s have a much greater protein content than the bacterial ones, the RNA cores from all the three lineages are homologous -- helices corresponding to P1, P2, P3, P4, and P10/11 are common to all cellular RNase P RNAs. Yet, there is considerable sequence variation, particularly among the eukaryotic RNAs.	116	1049	CL00002	303
RF00010	RNaseP_bact_a	Bacterial RNase P class A	SO:0000386	Gene; ribozyme;	Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a ubiquitous endoribonuclease, found in archaea, bacteria and eukarya as well as chloroplasts and mitochondria.

Yet, there is considerable sequence variation, particularly among the eukaryotic RNAs. Identified in Yersinia as Ysr151/RnpB. 	458	3712	CL00002	367
RF00011	RNaseP_bact_b	Bacterial RNase P class B	SO:0000386	Gene; ribozyme;	Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a ubiquitous endoribonuclease, found in archaea, bacteria and eukarya as well as chloroplasts and mitochondria.

RF00012	U3	Small nucleolar RNA U3	SO:0001179	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;	Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are involved in the processing and modification of rRNA in the nucleolus. There are two main classes of snoRNAs: the box C/D class, and the box H/ACA class. U3 snoRNA is a member of the box C/D class. Indeed, the box C/D element is a subset of the six short sequence elements found in all U3 snoRNAs, namely boxes A, A', B, C, C', and D. The U3 snoRNA secondary structure is characterised by a small 5' domain (with boxes A and A'), and a larger 3' domain (with boxes B, C, C', and D), the two domains being linked by a single-stranded hinge. Boxes B and C form the B/C motif, which appears to be exclusive to U3 snoRNAs, and boxes C' and D form the C'/D motif. The latter is functionally similar to the C/D motifs found in other snoRNAs. The 5' domain and the hinge region act as a pre-rRNA-binding domain. The 3' domain has conserved protein-binding sites. Both the box B/C and box C'/D motifs are sufficient for nuclear retention of U3 snoRNA. The box C'/D motif is also necessary for nucleolar localisation, stability and hyper-methylation of U3 snoRNA. Both box B/C and C'/D motifs are involved in specific protein interactions and are necessary for the rRNA processing functions of U3 snoRNA.	87	3579	CL00100	218
RF00013	6S	6S / SsrS RNA	SO:0000376	Gene;	E. coli 6S RNA was the first non coding RNA to be sequenced, but its function was unknown until recently. It consists of 184 nucleotides that fold into an extended hairpin structure with a large single-stranded internal bulge. The 6S RNA specifically associates with RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing the sigma70 specificity factor. This interaction represses expression from a sigma70-dependent promoter during stationary phase [1]. 6S RNA homologs have recently been identified in most bacterial genomes [2,3]. Many Gram-positive species have two copies of 6S RNA. In Bacillus subtilis, both copies appear to interact with RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing the housekeeping sigma factor and be expressed during different stages of growth. In many proteobacteria, 6S RNA may be processed from a transcript encoding homologs of the E. coli YgfA protein which is a putative methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase.	149	2526	NULL	188
RF00014	DsrA	DsrA RNA	SO:0000378	Gene; sRNA;	DsrA RNA regulates both transcription, by overcoming transcriptional silencing by the nucleoid-associated H-NS protein, and translation, by promoting efficient translation of the stress sigma factor, RpoS. These two activities of DsrA can be separated by mutation: the first of three stem-loops of the 85 nucleotide RNA is necessary for RpoS translation but not for anti-H-NS action, while the second stem-loop is essential for antisilencing and less critical for RpoS translation. The third stem-loop, which behaves as a transcription terminator, can be substituted by the trp transcription terminator without loss of either DsrA function. The sequence of the first stem-loop of DsrA is complementary with the upstream leader portion of RpoS messenger RNA, suggesting that pairing of DsrA with the RpoS message might be important for translational regulation.	5	55	NULL	85
RF00015	U4	U4 spliceosomal RNA	SO:0000393	Gene; snRNA; splicing;	U4 small nuclear RNA (U4 snRNA) is a component of the major U2-dependent spliceosome. It forms a duplex with U6, and with each splicing round, it is displaced from U6 (and the spliceosome) in an ATP-dependent manner, allowing U6 to re-fold and create the active site for splicing catalysis. A recycling process involving protein Prp24 re-anneals U4 and U6.	170	6885	CL00007	140
RF00016	SNORD14	Small nucleolar RNA SNORD14	SO:0000593	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;	U14 small nucleolar RNA (U14 snoRNA) is required for early cleavages of eukaryotic precursor rRNAs. In yeasts, this molecule possess a stem-loop region (known as the Y-domain) which is essential for function. A similar structure, but with a different consensus sequence, is found in plants, but is absent in vertebrates [1].	18	951	NULL	116
RF00017	Metazoa_SRP	Metazoan signal recognition particle RNA	SO:0000590	Gene;	The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a universally conserved ribonucleoprotein. It is involved in the co-translational targeting of proteins to membranes. The eukaryotic SRP consists of a 300-nucleotide 7S RNA and six proteins: SRPs 72, 68, 54, 19, 14, and 9. Archaeal SRP consists of a 7S RNA and homologues of the eukaryotic SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. Eukaryotic and archaeal 7S RNAs have very similar secondary structures, as represented by this family. Eight helical elements fold into the Alu and S domains, separated by a long linker region [1,2]. The Alu domain is thought to mediate the peptide chain elongation retardation function of the SRP [1]. The universally conserved helix which interacts with the SRP54 M domain mediates signal sequence recognition [2,3]. In eukaryotes and archaea, the SRP19-helix 6 complex is thought to be involved in SRP assembly and stabilises helix 8 for SRP54 binding [1]. The Signal Recognition Particle Database (SRPDB) [4] provides compilations of SRP components, with phylogenetic data and structural illustrations. Many sequences below the threshold for this family are clearly closely related, but are most likely to be SRP RNA derived pseudogenes. The human genome in particular is known to contain a large amount of SRP RNA related sequence, including Alu repeats. While the threshold of this family is set high so as to minimise the number of hits to such regions, it is likely that some remain.	91	45132	CL00003	301
RF00018	CsrB	CsrB/RsmB RNA family	SO:0000377	Gene; sRNA;	The CsrB RNA binds to approximately 18 copies of the CsrA protein Pfam:PF02599. CsrA proteins are found in a wide variety of bacteria. The CsrB RNAs contain a conserved motif CAGGXXG that is found in up to 18 copies and has been suggested to bind CsrA. The Csr regulatory system has a strong negative regulatory effect on glycogen biosynthesis, glyconeogenesis and glycogen catabolism and a positive regulatory effect on glycolysis [1]. In other bacteria such as Erwinia caratovara the RsmA protein has been shown to regulate the production of virulence determinants, such extracellular enzymes [2]. RsmA binds to RsmB regulatory RNA which is also a member of this family [2].	38	238	CL00106	356
RF00019	Y_RNA	Y RNA	SO:0000405	Gene;	Y RNAs are components of the Ro ribonucleoprotein particle (Ro RNP), in association with Ro60 and La proteins. The Y RNAs and Ro60 and La proteins are well conserved, but the function of the Ro RNP is not known. In humans the RNA component can be one of four small RNAs -- hY1, hY3, hY4 and hY5. These small RNAs are predicted to fold into a conserved secondary structure containing three stem structures. The largest of the four, hY1, contains an additional hairpin. This family includes a significant number of annotated pseudogenes and the model is expected to discriminate poorly between real and Y RNA related pseudogenes.	104	9217	NULL	98
RF00020	U5	U5 spliceosomal RNA	SO:0000395	Gene; snRNA; splicing;	U5 RNA is a component of both types of known spliceosome. The precise function of this molecule is unknown, though it is known that the 5' loop is required for splice site selection and p220 binding, and that both the 3' stem-loop and the Sm site are important for Sm protein binding and cap methylation.	180	6161	NULL	116
RF00021	Spot_42	Spot 42 RNA	SO:0000389	Gene; sRNA;	The physiological role of Escherichia coli Spot 42 (spf) RNA has remained obscure, even though the 109-nucleotide RNA was discovered almost three decades ago. Spot 42 seems to have a regulatory role on the galactose operon [1]. It is proposed that Spot 42 acts by an antisense mechanism where the RNA binds to the galK translation initiator region [1]. Changes in Spot 42 levels are implicated in affecting the adjacent DNA polymerase I levels [2]. The Hfq protein has been shown to interact with several small regulatory RNAs in E. coli, and the protein is required for OxyS, DsrA, RprA and Spot 42 RNA regulation [3].	19	182	NULL	115
RF00022	GcvB	GcvB RNA	SO:0000379	Gene;	The gcvB gene encodes a small untranslated RNA involved in expression of the dipeptide and oligopeptide transport systems in Escherichia coli. Included several unknown homologues in alignment (Bateman A pers obs).	27	196	NULL	198
RF00023	tmRNA	transfer-messenger RNA	SO:0000584	Gene;	Bacterial tmRNA, also known as 10Sa RNA or SsrA, is named for its dual tRNA and mRNA-like properties. Its role is to liberate the mRNA from a stalled ribosome. To accomplish this part of the tmRNA is used as a reading frame that ends in a translation stop signal. The broken mRNA is replaced in the ribosome by the tmRNA and translation of the tmRNA leads to addition of a proteolysis tag to the incomplete protein enabling recognition by a protease. Recently a number of permuted tmRNA genes have been found encoded in two parts. tmRNAs have been identified in eubacteria and some chloroplasts but are absent from archaeal and eukaryote nuclear genomes.	477	3938	CL00001	354
RF00024	Telomerase-vert	Vertebrate telomerase RNA	SO:0000390	Gene;	Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase that synthesises telomeric DNA. Telomerase RNAs differ greatly in sequence and structure between vertebrates, ciliates and yeasts, but they share a 5' pseudoknot structure close to the template sequence. Vertebrate telomerase RNAs have a 3' H/ACA snoRNA-like domain. This family also contains viral telomerase RNAs from the Gallid herpes viruses as described in [3].	37	65	CL00004	436
RF00025	Telomerase-cil	Ciliate telomerase RNA	SO:0000390	Gene;	Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase that synthesises telomeric DNA. Telomerase RNAs differ greatly in sequence and structure between vertebrates, ciliates and yeasts, but they share a 5' pseudoknot structure close to the template sequence.	20	5	CL00004	178
RF00026	U6	U6 spliceosomal RNA	SO:0000396	Gene; snRNA; splicing;	U6 snRNA is a component of the spliceosome which is involved in splicing pre-mRNA. The putative secondary structure consensus base pairing is confined to a short 5' stem loop, but U6 snRNA is thought to form extensive base-pair interactions with U4 snRNA [2]. This model hits a large number of sequences in vertebrate genomes, which appear to be U6 derived pseudogenes or repeats. This family has a high significance threshold to minimise this problem, but many annotated pseudogenes remain.	188	44263	CL00009	104
RF00027	let-7	let-7 microRNA precursor	SO:0001244	Gene; miRNA;	This family represents the microRNAs (miRNA) let-7 and mir-98. let-7 was identified from a study of developmental timing in C. elegans [1], and was later shown to be part of a much larger class of non-coding RNAs termed miRNAs [2]. Both miRNAs let-7 and mir-98 have now been predicted or experimentally confirmed in a wide range of species (MIPF:MIPF000002). miRNAs are transcribed as ~70nt precursors (modelled here) and subsequently processed by the Dicer enzyme to give a ~22nt product. The extents of the hairpin precursors are not generally known and are estimated based on hairpin prediction. The products are thought to have regulatory roles through complementarity to mRNA. The involvement of Dicer in miRNA processing suggests a relationship with the phenomenon of RNA interference. This family also includes the miR-98 precursor from human, which may be a let-7 homologue.	63	1361	NULL	84
RF00028	Intron_gpI	Group I catalytic intron	SO:0000587	Intron;	Group I catalytic introns are large self-splicing ribozymes. They catalyse their own excision from mRNA, tRNA and rRNA precursors in a wide range of organisms. The core secondary structure consists of 9 paired regions (P1-P9). These fold to essentially two domains - the P4-P6 domain (formed from the stacking of P5, P4, P6 and P6a helices) and the P3-P9 domain (formed from the P8, P3, P7 and P9 helices). The secondary structure mark-up for this family represents only this conserved core. Group I catalytic introns often have long ORFs inserted in loop regions. The window size for this search is chosen to minimise search time and catch the small examples. A larger window size will find more matches.	12	1510	NULL	251
RF00029	Intron_gpII	Group II catalytic intron	SO:0000603	Intron;	Group II introns are found in rRNA, tRNA and mRNA of organelles in fungi, plants and protists, and also in mRNA in bacteria. They are large self-splicing ribozymes and have 6 structural domains (usually designated dI to dVI. This model and alignment represents only domains V and VI. A subset of group II introns also encode essential splicing proteins in intronic ORFs. The length of these introns can therefore be up to 3kb. Splicing occurs in almost identical fashion to nuclear pre-mRNA splicing with two transesterification steps. The 2' hydroxyl of a bulged adenosine in domain VI attacks the 5' splice site, followed by nucleophilic attack on the 3' splice site by the 3' OH of the upstream exon. Protein machinery is required for splicing in vivo, and long range intron-intron and intron-exon interactions are important for splice site positioning. Group II introns are further sub-classified into groups IIA and IIB which differ in splice site consensus, distance of bulged A from 3' splice site, some tertiary interactions, and intronic ORF phylogeny [1].	92	10335	NULL	93
RF00030	RNase_MRP	RNase MRP	SO:0000385	Gene; ribozyme;	RNase MRP is an enzymatically active ribonucleoprotein with two distinct roles in eukaryotes. In mitochondria it plays a direct role in the initiation of mitochondrial DNA replication. In the nucleus it is involved in precursor rRNA processing, where it cleaves the internal transcribed spacer 1 between 18S and 5.8S rRNAs. Despite distinct functions, RNase MRP has been shown to be evolutionarily related to RNase P. Like eukaryotic RNase P, RNase MRP is not catalytically active without associated protein subunits.	66	867	CL00002	266
RF00031	SECIS_1	Selenocysteine insertion sequence 1	SO:1001274	Cis-reg;	The incorporation of selenocysteine into a protein sequence is directed by an in-frame UGA codon (usually a stop codon) within the coding region of the mRNA. Selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved secondary structure in the 3' UTR that is required for the distinction of UGA stop from UGA selenocysteine. The selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) is around 60 nt in length and adopts a hairpin structure which is sufficiently well-defined and conserved to act as a computational screen for selenoprotein genes [2].	61	583	NULL	64
RF00032	Histone3	Histone 3' UTR stem-loop	SO:0000205	Cis-reg;	The mRNAs of metazoan histone genes lack a poly-A tail. 3' end processing occurs at a site between a highly conserved stem-loop (modelled by this family) and a purine rich region around 20 nts downstream (the histone downstream element, or HDE). The stem-loop is bound by a 31 kDa stem-loop binding protein (SLBP - also termed the histone hairpin binding protein, or HBP). Together with U7 snRNA binding of the HDE, SLBP binding nucleate s the formation of the processing complex. The histone 3' UTR stem-loop is also involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport of the mRNA, and in stability regulation and translation efficiency in the cytoplasm.	46	23888	NULL	46
RF00033	MicF	MicF RNA	SO:0000383	Gene; antisense;	The micF gene is a stress response gene found in Escherichia coli and related bacteria that post-transcriptionally controls expression of the outer membrane porin gene ompF. The micF gene encodes a non-translated 93 nt antisense RNA that binds its target ompF mRNA and regulates ompF expression by inhibiting translation and inducing degradation of the message. In addition, other factors, such as the RNA chaperone protein StpA also play a role in this regulatory system. Expression of micF is controlled by both environmental and internal stress factors. Four transcriptional regulators are known to bind the micF promoter region and activate micF expression.	4	60	NULL	94
RF00034	RprA	RprA RNA	SO:0000387	Gene; sRNA;	Translational regulation of the stationary phase sigma factor RpoS is mediated by the formation of a double-stranded RNA stem-loop structure in the upstream region of the rpoS messenger RNA, occluding the translation initiation site. Clones carrying rprA (RpoS regulator RNA A) increased the translation of RpoS. The rprA gene encodes a 106 nucleotide regulatory RNA. As with DsrA Rfam:RF00014, RprA is predicted to form three stem-loops. Thus, at least two small RNAs, DsrA and RprA, participate in the positive regulation of RpoS translation. RprA also appears to bind to the RpoS leader [2]. RprA is non-essential [1]. The Y. pestis homologue was detected by similarity to the E. coli gene (pers obs. Bateman A).	13	99	NULL	108

It has been shown that the untranslated mRNA (UTR) preceding prfA, forms a secondary structure, which masks the ribosome binding region [1]. This family also contains UTRs from other closely related bacteria. The secondary structure of this motif forms a hairpin. The Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence is partly masked by the most conserved stem of the secondary structure. It is thought that at 37 degrees C the SD sequence is unmasked [1].	11	1	NULL	132

RNase E is a key regulatory enzyme in the pathway of mRNA degradation in E. coli that is able to auto-regulate the degradation of its own mRNA in response to changes in RNase E activity. This rne 5' UTR element acts as a sensor of cellular RNase E concentration enabling tight regulation of RNase E concentration and synthesis.	6	118	NULL	334

RF00044	Phage_pRNA	Bacteriophage pRNA	SO:0000655	Gene;	During replication of linear dsDNA viruses, the viral genome is packaged into the pre-formed viral procapsid. The packaging of DNA into the procapsid requires a molecular motor which using ATP as energy to accomplish the energetically unfavourable motion. In some bacteriophage, an RNA (pRNA) molecule is a vital component of this motor [1]. Structural analyses of the packaging motor have demonstrated that the pRNA molecule has fivefold symmetry when attached to the prohead [2-4]. The pRNA is thought to be bound by the capsid connector protein (PFAM:PF05352) [4]. Only the first 120 bases of the pRNA are essential for packing the viral DNA [5,6]. The pRNA is proposed to be comprised of two domains, one corresponding to the first 120 bases and the second to the remaining 50 bases [6]. Nuclear cleavage occurs in the single strand region linking these two domains [6].	3	2	NULL	244

It is one of the most abundant snoRNAs in human cells and is essential for the cleavage of pre-rRNA within the 5' external transcribed spacer (ETS) [1]. This cleavage leads to the formation of 18S rRNA. Regions of the U17 RNA are complementary to rRNA and act as guides for RNA/RNA interactions, although these regions do not seem to be well conserved between organisms [2].	66	465	CL00078	219

The ribosome can only bind the capped mRNA after binding the initiator tRNA. Translation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) mRNA is initiated by a different mechanism from the usual 5' cap-binding model [2]. This alternate mechanism relies on the direct binding of the 40S ribosomal subunit by the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5' UTR of HCV RNA. HCV IRES adopts a complex structure, and may differ significantly from IRES elements identified in picornaviruses.

RF00106	RNAI	RNAI	SO:0000644	Gene; antisense;	RNAI is an antisense repressor of the replication of some E. coli plasmids, including ColE1. Plasmid replication is usually initiated by RNAII, which acts as a primer by binding to its template DNA. The complementary RNAI binds RNAII prohibiting it from its initiation role. The rate of degradation of RNAI is therefore a major factor in control of plasmid replication. This rate of degradation is aided by the pcnB (plasmid copy number B) gene product, which polyadenylates the 3' end of RNAI targeting it for degradation by PNPase. Please note: This family contains subsequences annotated as human (Z96734), Arabidopsis (AB003142), Xenopus (X91243) and S. pombe (L25927, L25928), which match with highly significant scores.

RF00169	Bacteria_small_SRP	Bacterial small signal recognition particle RNA	SO:0000590	Gene;	The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a universally conserved ribonucleoprotein involved in the co-translational targeting of proteins to membranes. The eukaryotic SRP consists of a 300-nucleotide 7S RNA (RFAM:RF00017) and six proteins: SRPs 72, 68, 54, 19, 14, and 9. Archaeal SRP consists of a 7S RNA and homologues of the eukaryotic SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. In most bacteria, the SRP consists of a 4.5S RNA and the Ffh protein (a homologue of the eukaryotic SRP54 protein). Some Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis) have a longer eukaryote-like SRP RNA that includes an Alu domain [2]. The Alu domain of the longer SRP RNAs is not included in this model and therefore the reported bounds of some members are incorrect.

RF00170	msr	Retron msr RNA	SO:0000233	Gene;	Retron elements are found in a wide range of mainly Gram-negative bacteria. The retron encodes a reverse transcriptase that is responsible for the production of a small satellite DNA called msDNA (multi-copy single-stranded DNA). msDNA has both DNA (encoded by the retron msd gene) and RNA (encoded by the msr gene) components. The 5' end of msDNA is linked to an internal guanosine residue of the RNA strand by a 2'-5' linkage. The components of msDNA are poorly conserved in sequence between different organisms -- this family therefore represents only a subset of known msr genes. Despite considerable investigation, very little is known about the function of msDNA, the mobility of retron elements, or their effect on the host cell.	9	21	NULL	72

These domains are combined into a single family here. Reference [2] proposes that TSD-DSD interactions are involved in the mediation of viral RNA replication.

RF00173	Hairpin	Hairpin ribozyme	SO:0000374	Gene; ribozyme;	The hairpin ribozyme, like the hammerhead (RFAM:RF00008 and RFAM:RF00163), is found in RNA satellites of plant viruses. It was first identified in the minus strand of the tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV) satellite RNA where it catalyses a self-cleavage reaction to process the products of rolling circle virus replication to unit-length satellite RNA. The structure consists of 2 domains, A and B. The 3' arm of domain A, which closes helices 1 and 2, contains the cleavage site and is linked to helix 3 of domain B by a linker of variable length and sequence. This region is thus not included in this family. The hairpin ribozyme has been identified in only 3 plant satellite RNAs -- from TRSV, chicory yellow mottle virus (CYMV) and arabis mosaic virus (ARMV).	5	3	NULL	52

This family represents a cobalamin riboswitch (B12-element) which is widely distributed in 5' UTRs of vitamin B(12)-related genes in bacteria. Cobalamin in the form of adenosylcobalamin (Ado-CBL) is known to repress expression of genes for vitamin B(12) biosynthesis and be transported by a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism, which involves direct binding of Ado-CBL to 5' UTRs [2].	430	9244	CL00101	191

In this case the mature sequence comes from the 3' arm of the precursor. The extents of the hairpin precursors are not generally known and are estimated based on hairpin prediction. The products are thought to have regulatory roles through complementarity to mRNA. The involvement of Dicer in miRNA processing suggests a relationship with the phenomenon of RNA interference. miRNAs are numbered based on the sequence of the mature RNA. miR-24 has been identified in human and mouse [1].	17	163	NULL	68
RF00179	GAIT	GAIT element	SO:0000233	Cis-reg;	This family represents a cis-acting element in the 3'-UTR of the ceruloplasmin (Cp) gene called gamma interferon inhibitor of translation (GAIT). The GAIT element is involved in selective translational silencing of the Cp transcript. Ceruloplasmin (Cp) is a multifunctional, copper-containing glycoprotein produced by the liver and secreted into the plasma. As an acute-phase protein, its plasma concentration can double during multiple inflammatory conditions. Plasma Cp has been reported to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, including atherosclerosis, carotid restenosis after endarterectomy, and myocardial infarction. Translational silencing of Cp, and possibly other transcripts, mediated by the GAIT element may contribute to the resolution of the local inflammatory response following cytokine activation of macrophages [1].	8	31	NULL	71

REN-SRE is thought to destabilise the mRNA, promoting degradation of the sequence. It has been found that a number of proteins bind to the REN-SRE to stabilise the mRNA and promote translation. Renin is secreted by renal juxtaglomerular cells and catalyses the conversion of angiotensinogen into angiotensin I which is the rate-limiting step in the production of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II induces hypertension and REN therefore requires tight control to ensure expression appropriate to need [1].	13	33	NULL	37

These two clusters are named SNORD113 and SNORD114 respectively in the HGNC approved gene symbol nomenclature. The snoRNAs found in both clusters are clearly related and are represented here by a single family. These snoRNAs are intron encoded and are processed from the tissue-specific non-coding human MEG8 RNA, which lies downstream of the imprinted genes DLK1 and GTL2. snoRNAs 14q(I) and 14q(II) differ from previously identified C/D box snoRNAs in their expression profiles and lack of complementarity to rRNA and snRNA. Homologues of these snoRNAs are found in the imprinted non-coding mouse transcript Rian, and in the rat non-coding Bsr (brain-specific repetitive) RNA.	59	1414	CL00069	75

G-CSF is secreted by fibroblasts and endothelial cells in response to the inflammatory mediators interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor alpha and by activated macrophages. The synthesis of G-CSF is regulated both transcriptionally and through control of mRNA stability. In unstimulated cells G-CSF mRNA is unstable but becomes stabilised in response to IL-1 or tumour necrosis factor alpha, and also in the case of monocytes and macrophages, in response to lipopolysaccharide. It is likely that the presence of the SLDE in the G-CSF mRNA contributes to the specificity of regulation of G-CSF mRNA and enhances the rate of shortening of the poly(A) tail [1].	16	37	NULL	96

RF00373	RNaseP_arch	Archaeal RNase P	SO:0000386	Gene; ribozyme;	Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a ubiquitous endoribonuclease, found in archaea, bacteria and eukarya as well as chloroplasts and mitochondria. Its best characterised activity is the generation of mature 5'-ends of tRNAs by cleaving the 5'-leader elements of precursor-tRNAs. Cellular RNase Ps are ribonucleoproteins. RNA from bacterial RNase Ps retains its catalytic activity in the absence of the protein subunit, i.e. it is a ribozyme. Isolated eukaryotic and archaeal RNase P RNA has not been shown to retain its catalytic function, but is still essential for the catalytic activity of the holoenzyme. Although the archaeal and eukaryotic holoenzymes have a much greater protein content than the bacterial ones, the RNA cores from all the three lineages are homologous -- helices corresponding to P1, P2, P3, P4, and P10/11 are common to all cellular RNase P RNAs. Yet, there is considerable sequence variation, particularly among the eukaryotic RNAs.	70	175	CL00002	303

The terminator structure is recognised as a termination signal for RNA polymerase and the operon is not transcribed. This structure forms when the cell has an excess of the regulatory amino acid and ribosome movement over the leader transcript is not impeded [1]. When there is a deficiency of the charged tRNA of the regulatory amino acid the ribosome translating the leader peptide stalls and the antiterminator structure can form. This allows RNA polymerase to transcribe the operon [1]. In the Rfam alignment the consensus structure is of the terminator. The alternative consensus structure is the antiterminator structure.	25	170	NULL	118

There is currently only one other known self cleaving ribozyme in mammals, the CoTC motif (Rfam:RF00621)[2].	12	90	NULL	78
RF00623	P1	Pseudomonas sRNA P1	SO:0000655	Gene;	This small RNA (sRNA) was computationally identified in the genome of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its expression verified by northern blot analysis [1]. There appears to be two related copies of P1 sRNA in the P.aeruginosa PA01 genome and both copies appear to be located upstream of predicted glutamine synthetase genes. This sRNA appears to be conserved amongst several Pseudomonas species. P1 has a predicted Rho independent terminator at the 3' end but the function of P1 is unknown [1].	14	36	NULL	180

RF00626	Gurken	Gurken localisation signal	SO:0005836	Cis-reg;	Drosophila gurken mRNA is localized by dynein-mediated transport to a crescent near the oocyte nucleus, thus targeting the TGFalpha signal and forming the primary embryonic axes [1]. Gurken contains an RNA stem loop within the coding region that forms a signal for dynein-mediated RNA transport to the oocyte nucleus [1]. This hairpin is conserved in other drosophila species.	3	1	NULL	69

P15 is conserved across a wide range of Gammaproteobacteria. It appears to be consistently located upstream of a 3-deoxy-7-phosphoheptulonate synthase gene. P15 has a predicted Rho independent terminator at the 3'end but the function of P15 is unknown [1].	22	50	NULL	119
RF00628	RgsA	RgsA sRNA	SO:0000655	Gene; sRNA	This small RNA (sRNA) was computationally identified in the genome of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its expression verified by northern blot analysis [1]. P16 sRNA appears to be conserved across several Pseudomonas species and Azotobacter vinelandii. In these species it is consistently located downstream of a predicted TatD deoxyribonuclease gene. P16 has a predicted Rho independent terminator at the 3' end but the function of P16 is unknown [1]. It has been shown that this sRNA is transcribed from an RpoS-dependent promoter under positive, probably indirect GacA control in two Pseudomonas species. It was renamed RgsA (for regulation by GacA and stress).[2]	27	57	NULL	194
RF00629	P24	Pseudomonas sRNA P24	SO:0000655	Gene;	This small RNA (sRNA) was computationally identified in the genome of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its expression verified by Northern blot analysis [1]. P24 is conserved across several Pseudomonas species and in Azotobacter vinelandii. It appears to be consistently located between a hypothetical protein gene and a transcriptional regulator gene (AsnC family) in the genomes of all these species. P24 has a predicted Rho independent terminator at the 3' end but the function of P24 is unknown [1].	14	41	NULL	255
RF00630	P26	Pseudomonas sRNA P26	SO:0000655	Gene;	This small RNA (sRNA) was computationally identified in the genome of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its expression verified by northern blot analysis [1]. P26 is conserved across many Gammaproteobacteria species and appears to be consistently located between the DNA directed RNA polymerase (beta subunit) and 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 genes. There are two eukaryotic sequences (AAGJ02000785.1 and AAAB01036679.1) included in this alignment which appear to be contamination.	27	287	NULL	66

The ROSE element is a negative regulator of heat shock gene expression. The secondary structure is thought to be regulated by temperature. This regulation blocks access to the ribosome binding site under normal conditions. During heat shock however, the structure changes freeing the ribosome binding site and allowing expression to occur [1,2]. This family includes predicted members of the family from gamma-proteobacteria.	14	53	NULL	73

RF01846	Fungi_U3	Fungal small nucleolar RNA U3	SO:0001179	Gene; snRNA; snoRNA; CD-box;	Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are involved in the processing and modification of rRNA in the nucleolus. There are two main classes of snoRNAs: the box C/D class, and the box H/ACA class. U3 snoRNA is a member of the box C/D class. Indeed, the box C/D element is a subset of the six short sequence elements found in all U3 snoRNAs, namely boxes A, A', B, C, C', and D. The U3 snoRNA secondary structure is characterised by a small 5' domain (with boxes A and A'), and a larger 3' domain (with boxes B, C, C', and D), the two domains being linked by a single-stranded hinge. Boxes B and C form the B/C motif, which appears to be exclusive to U3 snoRNAs, and boxes C' and D form the C'/D motif. The latter is functionally similar to the C/D motifs found in other snoRNAs. The 5' domain and the hinge region act as a pre-rRNA-binding domain. The 3' domain has conserved protein-binding sites. Both the box B/C and box C'/D motifs are sufficient for nuclear retention of U3 snoRNA. The box C'/D motif is also necessary for nucleolar localisation, stability and hyper-methylation of U3 snoRNA. Both box B/C and C'/D motifs are involved in specific protein interactions and are necessary for the rRNA processing functions of U3 snoRNA.	66	490	CL00100	276

RF01854	Bacteria_large_SRP	Bacterial large signal recognition particle RNA	SO:0000590	Gene;	The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a universally conserved ribonucleoprotein involved in the co-translational targeting of proteins to membranes. The eukaryotic SRP consists of a 300-nucleotide 7S RNA (RFAM:RF00017) and six proteins: SRPs 72, 68, 54, 19, 14, and 9. Archaeal SRP consists of a 7S RNA and homologues of the eukaryotic SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. In most bacteria, the SRP consists of a 4.5S RNA and the Ffh protein (a homologue of the eukaryotic SRP54 protein). Some Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis) have a longer eukaryote-like SRP RNA that includes an Alu domain [2]. The Alu domain of the longer SRP RNAs is not included in this model and therefore the reported bounds of some members are incorrect. The Signal Recognition Particle Database (SRPDB) [1] provides compilations of SRP components, with phylogenetic data and structural illustrations.	92	719	CL00003	255
